Everyday Security Curriculum

## What is it?
The purpose of Everyday Security (EvSec) is to provide an open-source curriculum focused on educating people about different areas of security. It aims to collect and share knowledge from contributors in these different areas, and explain the key points in different ways based off the level of understanding needed. Since we all learn differently, these key points will be explained in mutliple different mediums including: computer-less & hands-on activities, comics, short and long-form posts.
