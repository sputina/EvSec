## Summary
Software uses processes to provide outputs to the end users. When you use a website to order a book, the process would likely involve adding an item to your cart, providing shipping and payment details, calculating item and shipping costs, and confirming the payment and the order. There are steps that need to be followed, in a certain order with certain checks, in order to complete a process.

These processes are developed by people, and are carried out by computers. For the computers - they just need to carry out a set of instructions.

What if the instructions were modified? What if the input they were given was not what they expected? What if the process and input was modified so the output received was - instead of 1 book - but a hundred free books? Or maybe the output from your website's database?

### Skills
* Process and risk assessment
* Risk management (mitigation with controls)
* Process manipulation
* Problem solving

### Materials
Each group should have:
* 1 Table
* 15 paper cups
* 1 mini race car
* 3 pieces of cardstock
* Tape
* Sheets of paper
* Pencil
* Whiteboard and markets (in lieu of sheets of paper and pencil if you have one)

### Activity Instructions
To learn about process manipulation, we are going to start with a simple process. Your group will be given materials and you must build a prototype for a car ramp. Over the time span of 30 seconds, each time the mini race car enters a cup, your team gets 10 points. If the car goes off the table, your team loses 10 points. The process is purposely vague and it is welcome to creative interpretation.

Each group should have at least 4 participants. The group will be split further into Team A and Team Z. Team A's goal is to win points. Team Z's goal is to make Team A lose points. There will be three rounds.

#### Round 1
Team A will have the task of creating a prototype and writing down the process instructions of building and using the prototype in order to get points. Team A will then have 30 seconds to read out and follow their process. Points are tallied and awarded to Team A.

#### Round 2
Team Z will then have a chance to manipulate the process to try and win points from Team A. Team Z will be able to modify up to 5 verbs, nouns, or numbers in the set of instructions produced by Team A. Team A will then have 30 seconds to read out and follow their process. Points are tallied and awarded (or taken away from) Team A.

#### Round 3
Team A will then have a chance to add mitigate the changes that Team Z have made by adding additional steps in their instructions. Team A can up to 5 new lines in their instructions to perform checks or safety nets to prevent point loss. Team A will then have 30 seconds to read out and follow their process.

### Debrief
* What type of role would Team A be in a real life scenario? Software development and building processes in not easy, and understanding your data inputs, process flows, and information outputs is critical.
* What type of role would Team Z be? Hacking is like creative problem solving - if this process was intended to provide points, how can I make it do something different just for fun - or for benefit (points)!
* Which team appeared to have the upper hand?
* Re-assess the instructions from Round 1 - what process risks do you see? In real life, a hacker would not necessarily be limited in what they can manipulate. What risks could have been mitigated in Round 1 with better process development?
* Taking this back to your day-to-day lift - what type of business processes are you involved in? What type of processes have you developed as part of an application you have made? What types of risks do you see now? What could you do to mitigate these risks? Or are these risks worth accepting? Why?
