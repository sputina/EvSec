# Protecting and Trading Information

## Summary
Most of the data and information we obtain today is from the internet. Whether that is open, freely available data or data that we must provide information about ourselves in order to obtain it (like personal details, payment). We can also trade our information in exchange for services, like a video game or web-based software.

Because we perform these exchanges online, more often than before, it is getting harder to tell when a trade is fair or safe.

### Skills
* Information and data exchange
* Value of information and privacy
* Online safety and awareness

### Materials
This activity requires:
* Space to move and interact
* Markers - Green, black, and red
* Post-it notes
* Pens
* Paper
* General purpose vinyl tape or blue painter's tape

### Activity Instructions
To learn about protecting and trading information online, we are going to simulate the internet, which is a globally connected computer network. The goal for the group is to interact with different websites in order to obtain data or information that they will need in order to build a prototype. This prototype can be anything that the participants are interested in - a space shuttle, a flying car, a really awesome widget.

There must be at least four participants that will represent websites. These websites should be standing around the room and should connect to a central point in the middle - which represents a search engine. The lines of tape that spider out from the central point to the participant websites represents a network of connected computers.

If you have more than four website volunteers, you can change the details below to create different scenarios.

#### Website A
This volunteer represents a website that provides information about the latest research performed about the prototype's industry, such as space science or automotive engineering. They have a piece of paper that shows a green lock and a web address ending in .govt.  The back side of the paper contains the TLS certificate details showing it is owned by a government department.

Their information is free and does not require any information from the users.

#### Website B
This volunteer represents a website that provides commercial information about the specifications of different prototype components, such as engines, rocket boosters, and batteries. They have a piece of paper that shows a green lock and a web address ending in .com.  The back side of the paper contains the TLS certificate details showing it is owned by Well-Known Conglomerate Inc.

In order to get this information you must provide your name, address, email address, date of birth, and credit card details. The information is not free and there is a low cost for each spec sheet you order.

#### Website C
This volunteer represents a website that also provides commercial information about the prototype components (like Website B). They have a piece of paper that does not have a lock and a web address ending in .science.  The back side of the paper is blank as there is no certificate.

In order to get this information you must provide your name, address, email address, date of birth, debit card details, your pin number, and a copy of your passport. The information is free and this information is just needed to create an account.

#### Website D
This volunteer represents a website that provides a computer-aided design (CAD) software. They have a piece of paper that shows a green lock which is followed by the company's name, Zoogle, in green. The web address ends in .com. The back side of the paper contains the TLS certificate details showing it is owned by Zoogle.

The service is free however you must provide your name, email, and address in order to access it.

#### Interaction
The remaining participants are given a pack of post-it notes and pens. They must move along the tape - like moving through the internet. They must go up to each website and determine if: 1) it is safe to interact with that website, 2) it is a fair exchange of information for the data or services they need. If a participant wishes to interact and exchange information with the website, they must write down the information the website needs on a post-it note, and hand it over to the website. The website must then write down the data or service they provide on a post-it note and hand it back to the participants.

Once all the participants have had a chance to assess (and if they choose to, interact) each website, go through each website as a group and explain which websites were the safer and which ones were fairer in their exchange for information.

* Website A - Likely safe (provided by a government department, has a TLS certificate owned by the government department) and fair (free, publicly funded research)
* Website B - Likely safe (provided by a well-known entity, has a TLS certificate owned by the entity) and likely fair (paying money for commercially sensitive data)
* Website C - Not safe (no TLS certificate, exchanging sensitive information over HTTP) and not fair (requiring sensitive personal details for data that does not require it)
* Website D - Likely safe (has a TLS certificate which displays the owner in the address bar) and likely fair (only requires limited personal contact details for access to the application)

### Debrief
* Even after deleting information or data that you might have provided or exchanged online, what could prevent it from being deleted forever?
* What is stopping an unsafe or malicious website from using the information you provided and giving it to someone else? 
* This activity focuses on if the exchange of information is safe and fair. What could you do to make sure the data you are receiving in exchange is actually correct or trustworthy?
* In this case the websites were all connected to a central point, the search engine you used. If there are links from one trusted website to another website, does that make it a more reputable source? What about if the website was defaced? How could you check a link before clicking through?
* Why is it important for a website to have a green lock and TLS certificate? If someone could see the requests you are making to a website, what could be at risk?
* There are free TLS certificate services available, such as [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), in order to encourage more websites to use HTTPS. How do these organisations operate and generate certificates compared to their commercial competitors? What are the pros and cons of using a free certificate service?
* Digital personas are identities that some people have online that are kept separate from their personal lives. When you are signing up and providing personal information in order to get access to a non-commercial or non-legal service, like a video game, can you use a digital identity? What can you research or read in order to verify this?
